Car price prediction Problem:

This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.


Approach:

By using Linear RandomForset Regressor , we are predicting the Car price based on user input data

Here we used Flask web applicationw with pyWebIO  and deployed in Heroku cloud platform (Platform As A service-PAAS) 

This helps to deploy without creating html code for web display while using Flask, so here no need templates, Static/css folder etc
